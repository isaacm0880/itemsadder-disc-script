**Overview**

This script creates itemsadder custom disc packs

It handles:

- items.yml
- categories.yml
- dictionaries/en.yml
- sounds.json
- Folder structure
- placeholder files for .ogg and .png assets


**Notes**

Make sure Python is installed

Namespace and disc names must be lowercase letters, numbers, or underscores

Spaces are converted to underscores

If you reopen the script, it will create a new namespace folder

I havnt tested windows, so i dont know if it will work, but i dont see why not


**Usage**

1. Open a terminal
2. go to the folder containing the script
3. Run python3 discscript.py
4. Enter the namespace
5. if you only wanted the placeholders, you can type done to end the script, _otherwise_:
6. type your disc name
7. type your disc description
8. repeat for as many discs as you want
9. once you are done, type done to end the script
